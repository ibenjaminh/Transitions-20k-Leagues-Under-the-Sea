## Guided project by Codecademy

The screenshot doesn't do much damage; therefore, it'd be best to visit the link to visualize the transitions! https://ibenjaminh.github.io/Transitions-20k-Leagues-Under-the-Sea/

## What's This Project All About?

In this project, I took an existing static web page that presents the full text of this iconic book and infused it with life using CSS transitions.

## How I Brought the Depths to the Surface

### The Animation Arsenal

Utilizing CSS transitions, I focused on adding smooth, engaging animations that complement the text without overwhelming it. This included transitions for:

- Page elements that subtly shift when interacted with.
- Text that gently fades in or out to draw attention to key passages or changes in the narrative.

### Following Codecademy's Map

This adventure was charted by Codecademy, which provided step-by-step instructions to introduce animations into the web page. Their guidance was the compass that directed the technical aspects of the project, from selecting the right properties to animate to implementing them in a way that enriches the reader's experience.

Thank you,
